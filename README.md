# circlengine

A very **tiny engine** for creating **video games** where every entity is a **circle**! A **fantasy console** that only displays circles.
Many retro-style games are pixelized, and refer to pixel art. Here, it is about an **uchrony** where it is easy for computers
to display circles. The basic drawing primitive is not blitting bitmaps, but drawing colored disks. This repository explores that would have been that uchrony. It consists in
an imaginary retro-console in that alternate history. The name is a tribute to the PC-engine.
